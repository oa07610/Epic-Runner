# Epic-Runner
A single player runner game developed using SDL game development library of C++. The player assumes the character of a young man who must dash through space while gathering coins and avoiding obstacles such as zombies, and beasts, by jumping and stop himself from colliding. Following are some rules and workflow of our project:

• Tasks to do are finding coins and eliminating foes. 

•	The objective of the game is to collect 10 coins withing the given range of lives. 

•	The obstacles can either be static or animated in this single-player game. 

•	The project includes standard game elements including a home menu page, an instruction page, Game Running Screen, Game over page, etc.

•	Games features include (but not limited to), sound feature, a pause function, and fundamental running game elements like jumping, slamming into objects, and collecting 
coins.  

•	Character has multiples lives which reduce upon colliding with the obstacles.

We have utilized standard OOP practices such as classes, polymorphism, inheritance, operator overloading, function overriding and design patterns. It was a university project for the course OOP Design and Methodologies.
