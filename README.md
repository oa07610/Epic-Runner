•	The obstacles can either be static or animated in this single-player game. 
•	The project includes standard game elements including a home menu page, an instruction page, Game Running Screen, Game over page, etc.
•	Games features include (but not limited to), sound feature, a pause function, and fundamental running game elements like jumping, slamming into objects, and collecting coins.
